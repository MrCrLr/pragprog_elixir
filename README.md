# [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/)
**by Dave Thomas**


I've decided to learn Elixir. I started seeing all these interesting sounding 
titles on [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/) and decided to look 
up some information about the language. It sounded fascinating to me the idea 
of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) 
and the fact that concurrency could be accomplished so simply. So, this is my 
first step towards learning.

So far I am enjoying the slightly new way of thinking and I am 
already feeling some inspiration to create something new. I look
forward to sharing my progress along the way here in this repository.

Once I finish this book I will likely be looking into [Network Programming in Elixir and Erlang]
(https://pragprog.com/titles/alnpee/network-programming-in-elixir-and-erlang/)
