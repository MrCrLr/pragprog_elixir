# Programming Elixir
**by Dave Thomas**


I've decided to learn Elixir. I started seeing all these interesting
sounding titles on Pragmatic Programmer and decided to look up some
information about the language. It sounded fascinating to me the idea
of functional programming and the fact that concurrency could be 
accomplished so simply. So, this is my first step towards learning.

So far I am enjoying the slightly new way of thinking and I am 
already feeling some inspiration to create something new. I look
forward to sharing my progress along the way here in this repository.
